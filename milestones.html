									<h4>Project Proposal</h4>
									<p>
										This is the start of the research project.<br/>
										We have submitted the proposal document to the panel.<br/>
										When creating this project proposal we considered the triple constraints which are scope,schedule and the cost
										We evaluated the core problem we are trying to solve by introducing out systems what can we achive with this what kind of resources
										are availabe to us and how much time do we have to implement a workable and presentable solution.<br/>

									<h4>SRS/DD/PPR assessment</h4>
									<p>
										According to the discussion with our supervisor, we have came to a conclusion to create design documents for all the features of the research project. So each of us made design documents to show case the feature  details.<br/>
										In this stage we went through many of the past research which might have some similarities with the system that we are trying to build.<br/>
										We also divded the work load and components in this stage and when dividing we made sure to that everyone would get piece of everything that is not horizontal slice but 
										a vertical slice.<br/>
										The date was 2019-05-13
